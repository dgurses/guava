Although not native to Southeast Asia, the guava has become a delicacy across many of the region’s cultures. From street names to cocktail recipes to traditional poetry, the guava has garnered culinary and cultural significance in Southeast Asia over the years.

Guava trees are small to medium-sized trees that can grow up to 10 meters tall. They have a short, thick trunk with smooth, brownish bark and a broad, spreading crown of branches. The leaves are oval-shaped and glossy, with a prominent midrib and veins. The flowers are white and have five petals, and the fruit is round to pear-shaped, with a thin, yellow or greenish skin and sweet, juicy flesh that turns from white to red as the fruit ripens. The fruit tree is native to Central America, northern South America, and the Caribbean but is widely cultivated throughout all of the tropics and subtropics.

The guava was likely brought to Southeast Asia by Spanish and Portuguese colonizers in the 15th and 16th centuries who introduced various tropical crops to the region during the colonial era. The exact details of how guava was brought over are unclear, but it is believed that the Spanish introduced it to the Philippines and the Portuguese into India.[^1] The guava tree thrived in Southeast Asia due to its adaptability to the region's tropical climate and soil conditions. Over time, the guava tree became naturalized, and it is now widely grown throughout the region, especially in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. With a long history in the region, the plant has become ingrained in many Southeast Asian cultures, whether it be traditional medicine or local food cultures, and is still enjoyed today by many.

In Malay/Indonesian the guava is called *jambu batu*, the word *jambu* having originated from Sanskrit. In Sanskrit jambu refers to a fruit or a rose apple, and is used to refer to a range of apple species in the Malay-speaking world. Of the “jambu (a species of apple) there are the jam bukling merah, (red) ayer mawa, (which tastes like rose water,) jambu bija, the guava, irong the cashew apple, another sort called britis”.[^2] Jambu batu is the name of the common guava with white flesh. When its flesh ripens and turns red the fruit is then referred to as *jambu batu merah* which simply translates to red guava. Jambu is used colloquially in Singapore to say pretty/beautiful and batu means rock in Malay so jambu batu literally means pretty rock.

The guava tree is common in all villages across Malaysia and Singapore and can still be found in old kampong areas in Singapore such as Pulau Ubin. Hence the guava tree has come to be identified closely with the kampong life and nostalgia for the kampong. In an oral history interview, Aloysious Leo De Conceicao, a bank officer and funeral minister who grew up in the east of Singapore, talks about the prevalence of jambu trees in the area in the late 30s and early 40s. According to Aloysious, there “were all these jambus, guavas, all types of guavas especially walking back from school in St. Patrick’s Road, Telok Kurau and all that, they had all types of jambu trees [like] jambu meral lah, jambu this, jambu rose apple”.[^3] He tells a story about how he and his friends used to go and pluck fruits from trees without permission. They would also take what the Malays call “cabang”, a fork-shaped branch from the trees. The jambu batu branches would be especially nicely grown in a “cabang” shape for the kids to take. Then they would cut the branches, burn them and make them into catapults. They were “fond of going to catapult birds or fruits which were high” using the catapults they made from the guava tree branches.[^4] Kannan Madhavan, too, a Singapore local born in 1946, recalls how he and other boys used to play barefoot climbing guava trees in the kampong in an oral interview.[^5]

The association of guava trees with the kampong can be seen in various local literary forms as well. The 1992-published poem ‘Malacca Song’ by Malaysian poet Chin Woon Ping, for example, talks of the “guava wind” as she reminisces about her rural hometown.[^6]

The *pantun* here, a Malay oral poetic form, also talks of guavas, showing once again what an integral part of traditional life the guava is. This pantun is a *nasihat* (advice) and relays that “like everything else in life, all positive endeavours need patience and time” to an “individual who is just starting her or his journey of knowledge”.[^7] So here the guava is used to symbolize a lesson learned or an achievement. This specific pantun belongs to the Melaka Chetti Indian community and is an example of the prevalence of the guava across diverse Southeast Asian cultures.

In Singapore, guava and the different jambu fruits are captured even in street names. The map below shows streets named ‘Jalan Jambu Ayer’, ‘Jalan Jambu Batu’, and ‘Jalan Jambu Mawar’.[^8] These streets, presumably named after the abundance of jambu trees in the area, still exist today in Bukit Timah.

In many Southeast Asian countries, guava is commonly used in local dishes and beverages. It is said that the guava “is delicious if stewed and served with cream, or in a pie”.[^9] It is also known to make “very good jam”.[^10] There are many different ways to enjoy guavas, sweet or savory, and different Southeast Asian cultures have their own traditional recipes. In the Philippines, for example, guavas are used to make a sour soup called sinigang no bayabas (pork in guava soup). The well-loved Filipino soup dish is "prepared with pork belly, vegetables and tomatoes cooked in a soup infused with guava” and “has that guava sweet taste”.[^11]

Another dish is asinan buah, a type of Indonesian pickled fruit salad that is “a specialty of the city of Bogor, West Java”.[^12] It is a “refreshing snack of fruit brined in vinegar, salt, and sugar” for which guavas are often used.[^13] In fact, guavas are used in many salad dishes in Indonesia, as well as in Singapore and Malaysia. One popular example is rojak, also known as rujak, which is of Javanese origin. It is a “ melange of crunchy fruits and vegetables, coated in a sticky sauce made of fermented shrimp” and “is sweet, salty, sour, crunchy and spicy all at once”.[^14] The popular mixed fruit salad is “a traditional Malay family favourite and one of Singapore’s most famous hawker dishes”.[^15] As rojak means ‘eclectic mix’ in colloquial Malay, the dish can be seen as a reflection of the cultural diversity of multiethnic countries like Malaysia and Singapore, “bringing together disparate items with strong flavours into a harmoniously tasty blend”.[^16]

Although mostly used as a side ingredient in local cuisines, guavas can be the main element of some dishes as well. The dish below shows guava slices served with ​​sng buay (sour plum) and dried orange peels at a Peranakan wedding in Singapore. The bride’s side is from Malaysia and they made it homemade. It was said that the guava “was soft and slightly sour, with a bit of sour plum powder then the orange peel made it very citrusy and fresh”.[^17] Guavas are commonly enjoyed raw with plum powder as a snack in Malaysia and Singapore and with chili salt in Thailand.

## This is a quick Markdown tutorial. Two hashes precede a heading. You can use these headings to divide sections of your essay.

*This makes things italics*. 

[This is how you add a link](https://www.juncture-digital.org/KatherineMEnright/speciesstories/)

This is how you add a mouse-over information panel from Wiki data: <span eid="Q170662">Mangosteen</span>
You can find the wikidata IDs by searching for proper nouns [here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). The ID is the series of digits following the letter Q.

**There's no spell-check feature built in, so keep a careful eye out!**

## Adding Images
       
You can use the QID tag within a sentence. For example: The <span eid="Q170662">mangosteen</span> is a non-native fruit found in Singapore. This is the code you use to add an image. Make sure to **close the tag**. It starts with **<param ve-image** and ends with a closing **>**. Within these tags, you can add information to help the program locate and describe the image. **While these examples are images, we can also include textual sources (particularly primary sources) in the media viewer where appropriate.**
<param ve-image 
       url="https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/V0044770/full/1338%2C/0/default.jpg"
       title="Mangosteen Photograph" 
       description="A mangosteen plant (Garcinia mangostana): fruiting branch and halved fruit. Photograph. Wellcome Collection.">
       
<span eid="Q271648">Marianne North</span> painted this painting of a 'Singapore monkey' amongst mangosteen fruits in 1875. You can also include "attribution" in the image information.
<param ve-image 
       url="https://d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/w1200h1200/collection/LSW/RBGM/LSW_RBGM_MN_CD6_577-001.jpg"

       license="CC BY-NC">
       
These are both examples of images added *from urls*. This is the preferred method. However, there might be some images you have to upload yourself. That's totally fine! Ideally, these files should be *as small as possible* and only .jpg or .png files will work. You should create a folder in your repository called "media" and upload the file there. Then, for the url, just copy and paste the item path: "media/{filename}.jpg". For more information on adding multiple images, comparisons, curtain sliders, and for how to zoom into particular sections of an image, check out the documentation [here](https://github.com/JSTOR-Labs/juncture/wiki/Visual-Essay-Image-Tag).

## Map

Mangosteens are found in Singapore. This takes a base map and sets the center to Singapore. The code after creates markers for different species, for instance, or to mark particular places on a map.
<param ve-map center="1.35, 103.9" zoom="11">
<param ve-map-marker
       url="https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/leaf-green.png"
       coords="1.3621, 103.8198"
       size="38, 95"
       iconAnchor="22, 94"
       shadowUrl="https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/leaf-shadow.png"
       shadowSize="50, 64">
<param ve-map-marker
url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Pinz%C3%B3n_azul_de_Gran_Canaria_%28macho%29%2C_M._A._Pe%C3%B1a.jpg/220px-Pinz%C3%B3n_azul_de_Gran_Canaria_%28macho%29%2C_M._A._Pe%C3%B1a.jpg"
       coords="1.4126, 103.9577"
       size="129, 170"
       circle="true">
    
    
You can create custom regions just by drawing shapes (no coding needed) using [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20). Then you can download the shape file and add it to your juncture media file as a map layer. Let's imagine this is the distribution range of your species.

<param ve-map center="1.35, 103.9" zoom="2">
<param ve-map-layer geojson url="/media/demomap.geojson" title="Sample Distribution"> 

## Add a YouTube Video
You can take the id from the YouTube URL. You can also define the start time with start="0:20" (for instance).
<param ve-video id="5upF4rJUxC4" title="NYBG 2019 Corpse Flower Timelapse">

## Add a Timeline
This uses the [Knightlab platform](https://timeline.knightlab.com/). The back-end, for you to use, will just be a googlesheets (so it's user friendly!). Here's an example:
<param ve-knightlab-timeline source="1T9E8QZRT7ZFFmb55uLpJUSnELKuqSsXlLmNuVXvOC_I" timenav-position="bottom" hash-bookmark="false" initial-zoom="1" height="640">


## Multiple viewers

Multiple viewers may be defined for a single paragraph of text.  The first viewer defined is displayed as the default viewer.  
Others are selectable using icons displayed in the top right margin of the paragraph.
<param ve-image 
       url="https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/V0044770/full/1338%2C/0/default.jpg"
       title="Mangosteen Photograph" 
       description="A mangosteen plant (Garcinia mangostana): fruiting branch and halved fruit. Photograph. Wellcome Collection.">
<param ve-map center="Q334" zoom="11" prefer-geojson>
